# NearbyEats

A React Native (Expo) app that shows your current location on a map and fetches nearby restaurants within a user-adjustable radius. Built with OpenStreetMap tiles and the Overpass API—no API keys required!

---

## 🗺️ Features

- **Current-location marker**: Pulsing Google-blue dot with white outline  
- **Nearby restaurants**: Pins for restaurants fetched via Overpass, labeled with their names  
- **Search bar**: Filter visible restaurants by name, with dropdown suggestions (up to 5)  
- **Adjustable radius**: Tap “Adjust radius” to reveal a translucent slider (0.5 – 5 miles); auto-hides after 4 s  
- **Safe‐area aware**: Layout respects notches and home indicators on iOS/Android
